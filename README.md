This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on wind speed data and building a machine learning model to forecast wind speeds. A Random Forest Regressor was utilized for the forecasting task, and the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Cross-Validation techniques.
The model is compared with the persistence model and the performance is better by 3.4%
